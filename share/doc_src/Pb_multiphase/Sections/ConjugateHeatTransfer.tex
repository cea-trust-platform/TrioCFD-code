\chapter{Fluid solid coupled simulations}

Since CMFD is a TRUST~\cite{trustonline} baltik dedicated to multi-phase flow fluid-solid coupled simulations can be easily perform. This section is composed of two sections. The first one explained the theory and the second one present a dataset needed to perform such simulation.

\section{Setting up data for fluid-solid simulation}

It is easy to perform a coupled calculation between two instances of TRIOCFD. An example is avaialable in TRIOCFD distribution in the following directory.
\begin{verbatim}
$ ls share/Validation/Rapports_automatiques/Multiphase/CMFD/CoolProp_Single_phase_Debora
\end{verbatim}

Dans TRUST : 
\begin{verbatim}
$ ls TRUST/Outils/ICoCo/ICoCo_src/share/Validation/Rapports_automatiques/CouplageFluideSolide
$ ls TRUST/Validation/Rapports_automatiques/Verification/Verification_codage/conduction_couple
