Purpose {
        Description "This test case was created to validate the fluid-structure partitioned coupling between an Euler-Bernoulli beam model for the structure and the incompressible viscous flow model of TrioCFD. "
        Description "It allows two-way explicit fluid-structure coupling where the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) module is used to consider the structure displacement/deformations in the fluid domain."
        Description "The coupling is similar to that presented in reference [1]. The points of difference are in the resolution of the beam model, which in our case uses a model-based solution, and in the construction of the displacement/deformation of the fluid-structure interface."
        Description "The geometry is taken from [2]. The validation investigates the free vibrations for a cantilever cylinder in static air and water. The cylinder frequency vibrations are compared to the reference data [2]."

		Description "Initially, the fluid is at rest."
		Description "The simulations were performed in air and in water"
		Description "In this test case we consider two configurations for the beam: 1) with boundary conditions at x=0 clamped type and at x=L free type (CF); 2) with boundary conditions at x=0 and x=L pinned type (PP)."
		Description "Initial conditions for the beam: at the beginning of the simulation an initial displacement of 0.0001 m is imposed to the beam (at x=L for the CF case and at x=L/2 for the PP case)."

Conclusion {

	Description The fluid-structure partitioned coupling between an Euler-Bernoulli beam model for the structure and the incompressible viscous flow model of TrioCFD was investigated through the simulations of the free vibrations for a cantilever cylinder in static air and water. The simulating natural frequencies in air and water well agree with the analytical solution [2]. Remark: in order to reduce the numerical error a much more refined mesh must be used!
