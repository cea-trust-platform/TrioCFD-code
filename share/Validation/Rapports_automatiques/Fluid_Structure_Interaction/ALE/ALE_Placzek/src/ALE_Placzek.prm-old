Purpose {	
	Description "The purpose is to assess the robustness of the ALE module implemented in TrioCFD, considering the case of a single oscillating cylinder subject to an incident laminar cross-flow. The results of our 2D numerical simulations are compared to those in [1] obtained with STAR-CCM."

		Description "We study the interaction between a moving cylinder and an incident cross-flow. The cylinder is imposed a sinusoidal displacement of frequency \latex_($F_0$\latex_) and amplitude $A$.  The frequency ratio is noted \latex_($f=F_0/F_s$\latex_) and the dimensionless amplitude is \latex_($A^*=A/D=0.25$\latex_). As in [1], our simulations are performed at a low Reynolds number \latex_($Re=DU_{\infty}/\nu=100$\latex_), with \latex_($U_{\infty}$\latex_) the incident uniform fluid velocity. For such a low Reynolds number, the flow is 2D and laminar. The computations start from the final state of the solution obtained with the fixed cylinder (from which we find a Strouhal number \latex_($St=F_s D/U_\infty= 0.167$\latex_), exactly as ref. [1]). The simulations are performed at different frequencies to cover both the lock-in and unlocked zones. A configuration is locked (resp. unlocked) if the frequency of the vortex shedding \latex_($F_s$\latex_) equals (resp. differs from) the frequency of the imposed cylinder displacement."

	model_options {
			Description "The fluid problem with moving boundaries is handled by the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method."
			Description "In the ALE approach, the fluid flow is computed in a domain that is deformed in order to follow the movement of the fluid-solid interface. It provides a hybrid description not associated with the fluid particles and the laboratory coordinates. We associate the description with a moving imaginary mesh that follows the fluid domain."

Results {

	Description "Locked configuration"
	Description "In order to highlight the lock-in phenomenous, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) is used. We can see that for $f=0.9$ there is only one peak at $f*=1$ i.e. at \latex_($f_0$\latex_) because \latex_($f*=f/f_0$\latex_) which shows that the vortex shedding is governed by the forced oscillation. The phase portraits also show that, indeed the cycle is well defined."

	Description "Unlocked configuration"
	Description " In order to get out of the lock-in zone, simulations at $f=0.5$ are performed. The lift coefficient is no longer only controlled by the forced oscillations. The lift coefficient signal is no longer purely sinusoidal, this can also be seen through the phase portraits which no longer have well defined limits. We can define the cycle-to-cycle period different from the period of the signal which can now extend over several oscillations (which we will call the beating period). For $F=0.5$, the Strouhal frequency from the fixed cylinder is placed at \latex_($f_s/f_0=1/F=2$\latex_). So we can see that the cycle-to-cycle period corresponds to the strouhal period \latex_($T_s=0.5T_0$\latex_) as found by ref. [1]."
