Objectif {
	Description "The aim of this test is to check the capability of the Front Tracking algorithm to model the deformations of the free surface of a drop hanging in the air."
	Description "In the current state, this sheet is not really a validation sheet strictly speaking. Indeed, no advanced comparison, whether whit other CFD codes or analytical results, is made. Some comparisons are nevertheless made on the evolution of the profile of the drop during the calculation with theoretical values but no reference is given."
	Description "In the future, validation will be redone on this sheet in order to improve the stability of the test case as well as the validation of this phenomenon with other codes, theoretical and/or analytical results."

Pb_description {
	Description "A water drop is present at the upper frontier of a closed box. Despite the presence of gravity effects, its position can be maintained hanged close to a solid wall, by the action of surface tension forces. Phenomena related to the contact angle close to the solid wall play an important role. The contact angle is the angle between the surface where is hanged the drop and the tangent at the meridians of the drop close to thesolid wall. It is measured on the external face of the drop. Its value leads to the determination of the amount of water that can be present in the drop, before it falls. The present test case is useful to analyse the way the surface tension forces are taken into account in the presence of contact angle. An emphasis is lain on the importance of parasitic currents. During the calculation, the bubble grows due to low velocity water injection. Water is injected at the center of the drop, via a boundary condition located in the wall. The surface involved in the boundary condition is much lower than the surface wettet by the drop. At the beginning of the process, the volume of the drop has a small value. Its shape tends to be a part of a sphere. Thereafter, it changes, due to hydrostatic pressure. The computationally obtained profile of the drop is compared to an analytical reference solution. Its shape is supposed to follow a cylindrical symetry. It is given by the integration of the following equation :" 	
	Description "\latex_($$ -\frac{\partial \theta }{\partial s} - \frac{\sin \theta}{x}\ =\ \frac{g\left(\rho_{l} - \rho_{g}\right)}{\sigma}\left( y - y_{0}\right)$$\latex_)."
	Description "The parameter \latex_($y_{0}$\latex_) is determinated so that the contact angle at the top frontier keeps a fixed, constant, given value. The entire profile of the drop is determined via a classical iteration Runge-Kutta method."
	Description "In the case modeled here, the following assumptions are taken: \latex_(\smallskip \latex_)
	Description " \latex_($\hookrightarrow$\latex_) The drop is hanged close to a solid support;"
	Description " \latex_($\hookrightarrow$\latex_) The gravity is upwardly oriented;"
	Description " \latex_($\hookrightarrow$\latex_) The y-axis is the axis of symmetry of the drop."
	Description " Solving the integral of the above equation with the previously mentioned hypotheses makes it possible to predict the theoretical profiles of a water drop in air, for different sizes, i.e for different amounts of water involved in it. Different contact angles with solid wall are also presented. Contact angle values are accounted in the air. The numerical accuracy is satisfactory, since the curvature and the contact angle are second order calculated.

This value will be defined in the boundary conditions of the testcase (see sub-section 2.2)."

		Description "Indeed, in Front-Tracking calculations, one can notice that the accuracy does not depend on the eulerian mesh only : the equilibrium profile is fully determinated via the geometrical curvature of interfaces and the gravity potentiel, which is evaluated at the interfacial nodes. It does not depend on discretised quantities related to the fixed mesh but to discretized quantities at the interface.  Thus, to properly capture the profile of the drop, it is necessary to define an effective remeshing.

	Description "The following graph the profile of the drop at different moment : t1 = 2.4s, t2 = 3.65s and t3= 6.45s and comparizons of positions of nodes of lagrangian mesh points and theoretical profiles."
	Description "Regarding profiles for 1.5 and 2.5 radians, one can notice that for low values of contact angle, the profile is less stable in time. Some spurious oscillations of the interface take place."

Conclusion {
	Description "This sheet demonstrate the capabilities of TrioCFD for the modeling of this type of phenomenon. A first comparison with the theory shows a good prediction of the shape of the drop over time. However, for drop contact angles greater than 90$^\circ$, the accuracy is deteriorated. A study will be carried out in order to understand the origin of these oscillations, reduce them and give recommendations for a good parameterization of Front-Tracking remeshing.""
