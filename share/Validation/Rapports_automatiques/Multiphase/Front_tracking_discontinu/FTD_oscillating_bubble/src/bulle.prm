Objectif {
	
	Description "The following study consists to validate the behavior of the Front Tracking algorithm implemented in TrioCFD code. The aim of this test is to check the capability of this algorithm to describe the oscillations of the interface between an air bubble and the surrounding water, so to check if the code ensures a good coupling between the surface tensions and the inertia. This two-phase flow configuration is based on a return to equilibrium of an initial deformed bubble via capillary oscillations .This test is validated by comparing the frequencies of oscillation and the rate of damping with analytical solutions.

Pb_description {
	Description "The test deals with the presence of a bubble in a box filled of liquid. Initially, the liquid is at rest. No gravity forces are taken into account. In the calculation, the initial shape of the bubble is slightly an ellipsoidal one (a deformed bubble with mode n=2).It makes it be out of equilibrium, its free surface is subject to oscillations. We expect to observe damped oscillations between a prolate form and an oblate schape.To investigate their frequencies, the analytical results to be used as reference are relative to inviscid fluids. Therefore. In addition, since the analytical results are non-dissipative, this test-case provides a tool to estimate the rate of the energy dissipation due to the modeling method. This is connected to the problem of numerical diffusion."
	Description " \latex_(\medskip \latex_)"
	Description "In this two-fluid problem, the following notations are introduced to describe the fluids and interface physical and transport properties. The two fluids are considered as non-miscible. The inclusion equivalent diameter is defined as the diameter of the sphere which volume is equal to that of the actual inclusion. Let \latex_($D$\latex_) be this diameter and \latex_($R$\latex_) the corresponding radius. The test makes sense if the physical properties correspond roughly to an inertia dominated flow with a very low viscosity for the gas and the liquid. This means that the capillary numbers based on the physical properties of each phase are very small. They are defined by:"

	Description "To validate the simulations, we will estimate the frequency of oscillations and the damping rates. These parameters will be analyzed and compared to the analytical models from the literature given by Lamb $[1]$ who derived the frequency of oscillations of such an inclusion. This derivation is based on the potential flow theory and is valid for any arbitrary inner and outer values of the density. This is shown for example by Lamb $[1]$, (p. 475, equation 10). The angular frequency of the oscillations is obtained for each mode by using the linearized momentum jump at the interface; it is given by:"

	Description "$\bullet$ \latex_(\textbf{Oscillation frequency and pressure difference}\latex_):"
	Description "\latex_(\smallskip \latex_) "
	
	Description "We compare the value of the frequency of the oscillation obtained in the calculation (case 1 and cas 2) to the theoretical one. We can see in the figures below that results are satisfactory.  The oscillations of free surface correspond to the theoritical value of 72  Hz. For more details, aned at first glance, the oscillation frequencies are double the reference frequency. Indeed, over an analytical period, we have two numerical periods as we can clearly see in the following figure. This is explained by the fact that the initial deformation of the bubble in mode 2 is equivalent to a flattened shape, it will oscillate in order to resume its most stable shape which is the spherical shape, passing through an elongated shape obtained after a first period of oscillation, then it will return to its original flattened shape after a second period of oscillation. It therefore takes two periods for the bubble to resume its initial deformation, and it is this period allowing an initial resumption of shape which is considered as a total period of oscillation as we can see in the second figure."
	Description "The pressure difference between inner and outer fluid is also correctly reproduced. The area of the ellipsoide which correspond to the amplitud of the frequency curve at time 0s is wel estimated. In the is  It seems this result could be considered as a reference calculation. One can see a time damping of oscillations. This effect is due to numerical diffusion due to the utilisation of the upwind scheme."

	Description " \latex_(\smallskip \latex_) "
	
	Description "Now, we will study the effect of the discretization scheme on the damping of the oscillations. For this, three numerical schemes will be analyzed : the Upwind (primary study), the centered and the Quick. From the figure bellow, it is clear that these three schemes give an identical result for the frequencies of oscillations. But he rate of damping is different, the uUpwind scheme dissipates more than the centered and the Quick, because this scheme induces more numerical diffusion unlike the centered and quick shemess which are of higher order and less diffusive.
	Description "Regarding the damping rate, it is in order of 0.02 s for the three schemes, so the influence of the numerical scheme is is very light. This is due to the remeshing procedure which is more prevalent, inducing surface tensions which modify the shape of the bubble. Its shape will tend to approach the equilibrium shape much faster, so the oscillations are damped."

	Description "After having validated simulations, we will interest on a very important criterion, it is the time step limit which ensures the stability of computation. It's defined as being the time step of the Navier Stokes equation beyond which the simulation becomes unstable. The added value of this present study is that can be generalized.Indeed, the aim is to find a CFL to integrate into the source code."
	
	Description " We will determine a limit for time step stability in order to find the proportionality factor which links this parameter to the spacing between two markers at the inetrface.In this study, the two cases of remeshing parameter were tested, in order to see if this proportionality varies according to the type of remeshing."
	
	Description "The results show that the limit time step stability varies linearly with the Lagrangian mesh, with a slope which depends on the parameters used in the algorithm of remeshing.The time step of stability decreases linearly with the refinement of the mesh. The proportionality factor between these two parameters is the slope which have unit of[s / m]. This slop must be dimensioned with a combination of physical parameters of fluids (viscosity, mass volume, surface tension ...).

Conclusion {

	Description "The present work consists of a validation of the Front-Tracking algorithm of TrioCFD on the case of the oscillating bubble. The bubble had good physical behavior during simulations when the interface remeshing parameters were well chosen.
	Description "The results converged to the analytical soliutions, this test case demonstrates the ability of the TrioCFD code to manage this flow topology. So, the Front-Tracking algorithm  has been validated."
