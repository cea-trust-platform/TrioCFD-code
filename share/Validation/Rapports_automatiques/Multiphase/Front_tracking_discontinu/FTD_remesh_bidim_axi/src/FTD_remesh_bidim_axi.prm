\latex_( Several values are tested for the number of barycentrage iterations (0,1,5) with a constant parametrisation for the VoF part (VoF:100; 
besides \latex_)triokeyword(nb_iter_correction_volume) in triokeyword(remaillage)\latex_( which represents the nb\_iter\_bary\_volume\_seul is always set to 3).
Most issues are near rotation axis.
Visualization are from the last timestep. 
Theoretical value of curvature is -10000 but depending on the number of barycentring iterations we get : 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $n=0$ : curvature in [-10011:-9993] which is perfect. 
 \item $n=1$ : curvature in [-15002:-9633] which is still reasonable. Nontheless, over long times, barycentring affects 
nodes close to the symetry axis mostly. It may be due to the linearization performed in the calculation of the volume differential?
 \item $n=5$ : curvature in [-39587:-8920] which is even worst. 
\end{itemize}
\latex_)

If the timestep is decreased, more barycentrage will be performed and it will be getting worst.

	Description "\latex_(\clearpage ~\\\latex_) " <<EOF
Be careful, these tests were performed with enough smoothing iterations 
(ie. triokeyword(lissage_courbure_iterations_systematique) and triokeyword(lissage_courbure_iterations_si_remaillage) 
both set to 5). In addition, the threshold on volume correction triokeyword(seuil_dvolume_residuel) was low enough (1.e-15)
and the corresponding iterations sufficient (triokeyword(VOFlike_correction_volume) 1 to activate the VoF correction 
and triokeyword(nb_iterations_correction_volume) 0, which means that no more 
correction are done after the end of barycentrage and lissage) to have a constant volume.

It is possible that the error on the interfacial shape close to the symetry axis can be explained as follows. 
Barycentring is performed in the tangential direction. The tangent vector is estimated with respect to the normal
by a first order approximation of the volume differential. It is not perfect and therefore, even barycentring 
(that is theoretically in the tangential plane) creates slight volume variations. They are collected by the code 
along the interface (each vertex has a theoretical volume correction). Lissage can also generate volume variations
that differs from the theoretical one (due to sequential vertex motion, but also to the differential approximation). 
After lissage and barycentrage are finished, additional iterations for volume correction only can be performed, 
but only if the global error on volume variation is above triokeyword(seuil_dvolume_residuel) AND if 
triokeyword(nb_iterations_correction_volume) is not set to 0.
In any case, there is no guarantee that the volume correction is satisfied locally. It seems possible then that the
unexpected-volume-variation generated by the barycentrage (which is given as a reference to the lissage correction)
or by the difference between expected and real volume-variation during lissage
is NOT corrected perfectly locally, but the loop will stop on the GLOBAL threshold triokeyword(seuil_dvolume_residuel)
or on lack of triokeyword(nb_iterations_correction_volume).
Apparently, the activation of triokeyword(VOFlike_correction_volume) is insignificant on that static case.

Even with enough iterations, we don't know if the local error can be decreased.

Chapter {
	Title "VDF, bidim-axi, case of moving interface."
	Description "So far, the effect of barycentring operations have been assessed." <<EOF
It was done with triokeyword(nb_iterations_correction_volume) and triokeyword(nb_lissage_correction_volume) both set to 0 
(but triokeyword(VOFlike_correction_volume) 1 to activate volume correction during lissage and barycentrage and 
besides triokeyword(nb_iter_correction_volume) in triokeyword(remaillage) which represents the triokeyword(nb_iter_bary_volume_seul) is always set to 3)
to minimize side-effects from other parameters. 

Now, we investigate bubble growth. 
The rate of growth is not taken from energy resolution but enforced by triokeyword(prescribed_mpoint) -0.3. 
On this new case, we can clearly see the importance of the timestep (controlled here by the facsec).
With facsec=0.1, the solver is unstable, unphysical vortices appears (see spurrious currents on figure below). 
With facsec=0.05, the solution remains stable. Reasonable/moderate vortices develops (only seen in the vapor where 
the velocity is theoretically zero). Subsequent tests are thus performed with facsec=0.05.

Regarding the triplet of keywords (triokeyword(VOFlike_correction_volume), triokeyword(nb_iterations_correction_volume), triokeyword(nb_lissage_correction_volume))
we set them to several values (among 000 100 111 133), to (i) iterate a few times times to get the correct dI/dt 
(the second iteration probably already has a very weak impact compared to the first), and also to (ii) 
smooth the dI/dt correction to avoid pikes on the interface. This parameter triokeyword(nb_lissage_correction_volume) 
is expected to be important when dealing with growth due to non-uniform phase-change.
But in fact here, these 3 parameters have no impact at all. It is probably because for any keyword combination, as long as triokeyword(nb_iter_barycentrage) 
or triokeyword(lissage_courbure_iterations_*) are not zero, there will be as much volume correction (and here, there will also be 3 additional corrections
as triokeyword(nb_iter_correction_volume) in triokeyword(remaillage) which represents the triokeyword(nb_iter_bary_volume_seul) is always set to 3).
