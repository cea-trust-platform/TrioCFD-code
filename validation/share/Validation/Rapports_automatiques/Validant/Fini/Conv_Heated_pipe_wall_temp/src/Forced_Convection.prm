The post processed value Tpost is close to Tequi as expected (see above). If the convection is considered neglectable in the calculation, Tequi and Tpost are (almost) the same. It is the same for stretched meshes giving 1D solutions. The two values are close for the standard and icem mesh, though the difference is higher for alpha=1.

        Description " - In order to obtain a proper heat exchange at the wall, the use of the standard temperature field calculated by Trio_U at the wall will not give good results as it takes into account the convection terms. "

For most cases, the use of alpha=0.2 gives more homogeneous results of the wall temperature. Considering the temperature at the wall or the heat fluxes at the wall, both values give similar results (apart for  the deteriorated case)."
